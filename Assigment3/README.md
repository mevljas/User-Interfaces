# Assigment 3

The insurance company **No Worries** decided to replace the current application they used to collect the data for the particular car insurances. For the development of the application they decided to rely on their own knowledge, so the application, that is displayed on the image below, was created. Unfortunately, the users (insurance agents) complained, that the user interface of the new application is not appropriate for use.The designers of the user interface namely haven't followed the principles and guidelines for developing user interfaces. So they decided to ask assistance of the experienced programmers (you), who have to help them to design and implement the application in such a way, that it will be suitable for use.

Your task is to design and implement again the application shown below. Your application has to offer the ability to collect all the data that previous application allowed. The new user interface should be designed according to the ten Nielsen's principles and guidelines for developing user interfaces. Thus, some of the widgets or the application elements might have to be replaced, since the existing widgets might not be properly selected. When selecting widgets follow the guidelines and rules for selecting graphic elements for interaction according to the conditions. Properly arrange the elements of the user interface. When arranging the elements follow the guidelines for arranging graphic elements for interaction: techniques for achieving simplicity, balancing, grouping (white spaces, borders), orientation and adjustments. Also, you have to graphically design the user interface in a proper manner. In accordance with the guidelines for designing user interface select text and colours correctly.

Your application should also enable setting the already entered values to the default value ("Default values") and writing the entered values into the database ("Save values"), which can be represented by a text file. The application should also verify that all the values were entered. If not, the application should report this to the user. The application should also check for the validity of the data (e.g. existence of a given date) or a format of the data (e.g. post number abc123 is not a correct format in Slovenia). If you wish you can also add features to the interface.
